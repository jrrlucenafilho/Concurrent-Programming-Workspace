/** Comments (Same on both files): 
 * Well, the implementation using processes should use more resources and mem since there's a bigger
 * overhead while dealing with them, and because they copy the entirety of the .c file source code, as oposed
 * to threads, which only execute one function at a time and have shared mem in the form
 * of global variables, (which wasn't really needed in my implementations of this program since it was more string-based).
 * 
 * So, Processes version should take longer thanks to this overhead i just explained that is needed to run them
 * and not on threads.
 * 
 * This same overhead in memory needed also affects the execution time. So the threads version should be faster and
 * need less memory overhead
